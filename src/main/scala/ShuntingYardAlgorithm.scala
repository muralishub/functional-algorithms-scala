// We are used to doing mathematical expression using infix notations, which will be hard to write a programme to evaluate this expression
//Rules:
//One: Numbers go directly from right to left
//Operators go south
//Operators then move to left
// if we are moving operators to south some operators has precedence which we need to check because if * is already in south and we have to compare when working with - then we flush * to left
// if we work on parenthesis we move left parentheis as normal and when we work on close parenthesis , we remove both parenthesis and move operands to left
